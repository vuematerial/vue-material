Reporting a bug?
================

- Always search for your issue first. It may have already been answered, planned or fixed in some branch.
- Open one issue per subject. Cluttered issues will be closed.
- Make sure to only create issues for the newest version.
- Create a declarative title and describe clearly the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 3 days, it will be closed.
- If you want to show your code, please use https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vuematerial/examples/tree/master/examples/quick-start
- In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you have fixed it.
- For bugs that involves build setups, you can create a reproduction repository with steps in the README.
- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. 

Have a feature request?
=======================

- Remove the template from below and provide thoughtful commentary.
- Answer those questions:
  - What will it allow you to do that you can't do today?
  - How will it make current work-arounds straightforward?
  - What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid?

Do not create new features based on a problem that will only solve edge cases for your project. Remember that Vue Material aims to be lightweight and clean. :)
