      <h2 class="md-title">How did Vue Material started?</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time I was working in a company, in projects for Google, using only Google's technologies. As a Front End Engineer I had to use Angular or Polymer as a solution back there. And we needed to build everything with Material Design. They chose to work with Angular and Angular Material only because it was more mature than Polymer at the time. It was not my choice and I felt that it wasn't good for me! But looking on the bright side, it gave me a really good experience with Material Design guidelines.</p>
      <p>I work with Vue since the 1.0 version and I love it. Vue Material started as a small and simple idea that I had in a boring saturday afternoon, to solve my own needs for a simple, fast and reliable solution with Material Design for Vue, because I couldn't find a good solution. So I started to develop my own library, to fix problems that I had on Angular Material's days and focusing on making things easier and practical to use.</p>
      <p>This project started as a side project and became the library as it is today, one of the most used UI Libraries for Vue.js!</p>
